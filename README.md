# Drunk-Sailor
Story of a drunk sailor with input functionality to plug in the user's name/gender into the story.


# Current bugs
- Need to enable a way to loop or modify the varaibles prior to rendering the story.
    - Reason being is that if the user inputs "N" for the data confirmation it failes. I need this input to trigger a loop or variable modification input so that the user can modify the story data.
